# JEECode: Personalized Adaptive Recommendation System for JEE

**JEECode** is a Personalized Adaptive Question Recommendation Platform designed specifically for JEE aspirants. By utilizing advanced algorithms and machine learning techniques, JEECode aims to revolutionize exam preparation by providing a tailored learning experience for every student.

### üöÄ About the Project
JEECode offers a unique approach to exam preparation by integrating a machine learning model that adapts to each user's performance. The platform personalizes the next question based on a user‚Äôs performance in previous questions, using adaptive algorithms to dynamically adjust question ratings and user ratings according to key performance metrics such as time taken and accuracy.

### üß† Key Features
- **Adaptive Question Recommendation**: Uses machine learning algorithms to tailor question difficulty to match user performance, dynamically adjusting based on metrics like time and accuracy.
- **Real-Time Quiz Matching**: Pairs users based on adaptive ratings, ensuring fair competition and effective learning.
- **Performance-Based Adaptation**: Continuously adapts question recommendations and difficulty levels according to user performance metrics such as time spent on questions and answer accuracy.
- **Progress Visualization**: Utilizes Chart.js to provide graphical representations of user progress, enhancing the learning experience.
- **Secure User Authentication**: Integrates JWT tokens for secure user authentication and role-based access control.
- **Auto-Login Functionality**: Provides a seamless user experience with cookie-based auto-login functionality.

### üñ•Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React, React-Router-Dom, Material-UI (MUI), Emotion (CSS-in-JS), Axios, React Icons, Redux Toolkit, React Toastify.
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, Mongoose (MongoDB), Bcrypt, Cookie-Parser, Cors, Dotenv, JSON Web Tokens (JWT), Google OAuth, Nodemailer.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Adaptive algorithms adjust user and question ratings dynamically, based on performance metrics like time taken and accuracy.
- **Development Tools**: Vite (Development and Build), ESLint (Code Linting).
- **Deployment**: Render.com
